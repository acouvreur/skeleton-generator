			</h2>

			<p>
				Much has been written about the MDD. It would be useless and tedious
				to give you a comprehensive list of its benefits and pitfalls.<br />
				The skeleton-generator project uses an original approach : whereas
				most of MDD tools are based on a UML representation of the domain
				model, we use a XML representation of a Database schema with
				additional metadata.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<a name="our-domain-model-representation" class="anchor"
					href="#our-domain-model-representation"><span
					class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our domain model representation
			</h2>

			<p>In our different application skeletons, the domain model comes
				in three different ways :
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the database</li>
				<li>In the business objects that are handled by services</li>
				<li>In the presentation layer where we use the MVC pattern with
					"easy to bind" objects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Each of these layers use a different projection of the domain model
			and need additional metadata to manage it properly. We have chosen to
			fully represent them the way we would represent a database in a
			single XML file. We systematically use a "one business object - one
			table" pattern. the additional metadata we add should allow to
			describe :
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The relationships between objects</li>
				<li>The behaviour of objects with respect to other related
					objects</li>
				<li>The way objects will be handled in the UI (if there is
					one).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			This XML file will take its place in your SCM the most natural way !
			</p>

				<a name="raise-productivity" class="anchor"
					href="#raise-productivity"> <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
				</a> Raise productivity...
			</h2>

			<p>
				Code generation is one the main axes on which high productivity
				frameworks are based. We don't have the ambition to provide such a
				framework. We simply use popular open source Java frameworks such as
				Hibernate, Spring,... and put them together so as to build a
				coherent skeleton that developers can rely on.<br /> This way, we
				can help you save time when setting up your project, produce and
				assemble your different layers and expose basic services.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<a name="improve-quality" class="anchor" href="#improve-quality">
					<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
				</a> Improve quality...
			</h2>

			<p>We have the ambition to help you produce high quality and
				sustainable code. The skeletons we generate rely on design patterns
				with accordance to Java standards. We have spent a lot of time (and
				will keep spending a lot of time) studying the official
				documentations of the frameworks we use to meet best practices.</p>

			<h2>
				<a name="keep-flexibility-" class="anchor" href="#keep-flexibility-">
					<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
				</a> ...keep flexibility !
			</h2>

			<p>One of the major advantages of our approach is that you can
				still use those popular, widespread and well documented Java
				frameworks without needing to spend a lot of time learning one or
				another. But more important, you will keep the flexibility of those
				frameworks : even if some high productivity frameworks are based on the same
				frameworks (such as Grails), it can be a pain when you really need
				to disturb the piping. In our case, you have a full access to the
				pipe !<br/>
				The point is : how to evolve our domain model without
				breaking what we have rewritten ? We simply have a commentary header
				that tells you whether you can edit or not a file. When you can edit
				a file, we use tags to tell the generator not to overwrite what is
				inside as well as it will take care of your java imports... The
				design patterns we use enable you to specialize your code by
				overriding some functions, or simply by enriching the classes or
				interfaces behaviour. We also strongly recommend aspect oriented
				programming to make things even more sustainable. Sure you will be
				astonished to see how generated and non-generated code can live
				together in harmony !</p>
